<h1>Incident Report Analysis
  </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this example I am a security analyst working for a multimedia company that offers web design services, along with other services to small businesses online. The company experiences a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network. This attack was acted on by a malicious actor who had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company's network through an unconfigured firewall.
